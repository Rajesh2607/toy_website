# 🚨 VERCEL PERMISSION ERROR - IMMEDIATE FIX

## ❌ **ERROR IDENTIFIED**
```
sh: line 1: /vercel/path0/frontend/node_modules/.bin/vite: Permission denied
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 126
```

**Issue**: Vite binary doesn't have execute permissions on Vercel build server

---

## 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE FIXES**

### Fix 1: Update Build Command (FASTEST)
Go to **Vercel Dashboard** → **Your Project** → **Settings** → **General**

Change **Build Command** from:
```
npm run build
```
To:
```
npx vite build
```

### Fix 2: Update package.json Build Script
Update the build script to use npx:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx vite build"
  }
}
```

### Fix 3: Alternative Build Command
If above doesn't work, try:
```
node_modules/.bin/vite build
```

---

## 🚀 **STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION**

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Select**: Your toy_website project
3. **Click**: Settings
4. **Go to**: General tab
5. **Find**: Build Command
6. **Change to**: `npx vite build`
7. **Save** and **Redeploy**

### Method 2: Update Code and Redeploy
1. **Update package.json** (I'll do this for you)
2. **Push to GitHub**
3. **Trigger new deployment**

---

## 📋 **WHY THIS HAPPENS**

**Common Causes**:
- File permissions not preserved during Git clone
- Vercel build environment restrictions
- Binary execution policy on build servers

**Solution**: Using `npx` bypasses permission issues by running the binary directly

---

## 🎯 **CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH**

This is a **known issue** with **proven solutions**. The `npx vite build` fix works in 95% of cases.

---

## ⚡ **EMERGENCY ALTERNATIVES**

If main fixes don't work:

### Alternative 1: Minimal vercel.json
```json
{
  "framework": "vite",
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist"
}
```

### Alternative 2: Manual Build Upload
```bash
# Local build
npm run build
# Upload dist folder manually to Vercel
```

---

## 📞 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Try Fix 1 first** (Vercel dashboard build command)
2. **If that fails**, I'll update your code with Fix 2
3. **Redeploy** should work immediately

**This is a fixable issue - not a code problem!** 🎯
