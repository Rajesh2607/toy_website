# Quick Fix for Vercel Deployment Error

## The Issue
You're getting a "Permission denied" error because Vercel is trying to execute build commands from the wrong directory.

## Solution

### Option 1: Redeploy with Correct Settings (Recommended)

1. **Go to your Vercel project dashboard**
2. **Go to Settings â†’ General**
3. **Update the following settings:**
   - **Root Directory**: Set to `frontend`
   - **Build Command**: Leave as default (`npm run build`)
   - **Output Directory**: Leave as default (`dist`)
   - **Install Command**: Leave as default (`npm install`)

4. **Redeploy your project**

### Option 2: Create New Project (If settings don't save)

1. **Delete the current Vercel project**
2. **Create a new project**
3. **When importing from GitHub:**
   - Select your repository
   - **IMPORTANT**: Set Root Directory to `frontend`
   - Framework will auto-detect as Vite
   - Keep all other settings as default

## Why This Happens

- Your project structure has the frontend in a `frontend/` subdirectory
- Vercel was trying to run build commands from the root directory
- The frontend `package.json` and `node_modules` are in the `frontend/` folder
- Setting Root Directory to `frontend` tells Vercel to treat that folder as the project root

## Environment Variables

Don't forget to set your environment variables in the new project:
- `VITE_API_URL` (update with your Render backend URL once deployed)
- All other `VITE_*` variables from the deployment guide

## Test Your Fix

After redeploying, your build should succeed and the site should work properly!
