# Vercel Deployment Guide - UPDATED

## ⚠️ ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

**Problem**: Frontend shows "Failed to fetch" error
**Root Cause**: Environment variables not properly configured in Vercel
**Status**: ✅ Backend working, ❌ Frontend needs environment variable fix

### Backend Status: ✅ WORKING
- URL: `https://toy-website-backend.onrender.com/api`
- Test: `https://toy-website-backend.onrender.com/api/products` returns data
- CORS: Properly configured for *.vercel.app domains

### Frontend Issue: Environment Variables Missing
The deployed frontend is trying to connect to `http://localhost:5000/api` instead of the production backend.

## IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. **Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. **Select your toy_website project**
3. **Settings → Environment Variables**
4. **Add these variables** (copy exactly):

```
VITE_API_URL = https://toy-website-backend.onrender.com/api
VITE_APP_NAME = Kids Toys Ecommerce  
VITE_DEV_MODE = false
VITE_DEBUG = false
VITE_IMAGE_QUALITY = 85
VITE_LAZY_LOADING = true
VITE_CACHE_TTL = 300000
VITE_PAGINATION_LIMIT = 12
VITE_ENABLE_INFINITE_SCROLL = true
VITE_ENABLE_VIRTUAL_SCROLLING = false
VITE_ENABLE_SERVICE_WORKER = true
```

### Step 2: Redeploy
1. **Go to Deployments tab**
2. **Click the 3 dots next to latest deployment**
3. **Click "Redeploy"**

### Step 3: Test the Fix
After redeployment, visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api-test.html`
This will test if the API connection is working.

## Alternative Deployment Methods (If Vercel Still Issues)

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. **Click "Add New... → Project"**
3. **Import from GitHub**: Select `Rajesh2607/toy_website`
4. **Configure:**
   - **Root Directory**: Set to `frontend`
   - **Framework**: Vite (auto-detected)
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`

5. **Add Environment Variables** (before deployment):
   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://toy-website-backend.onrender.com/api
   VITE_APP_NAME = Kids Toys Ecommerce  
   VITE_DEV_MODE = false
   VITE_DEBUG = false
   VITE_IMAGE_QUALITY = 85
   VITE_LAZY_LOADING = true
   VITE_CACHE_TTL = 300000
   VITE_PAGINATION_LIMIT = 12
   VITE_ENABLE_INFINITE_SCROLL = true
   VITE_ENABLE_VIRTUAL_SCROLLING = false
   VITE_ENABLE_SERVICE_WORKER = true
   ```

6. **Click "Deploy"**

## Method 2: Manual Build + Upload

```bash
# In the frontend folder
npm run build

# Then upload the dist folder to any static hosting service
```

## Method 3: Netlify Alternative

1. **Go to https://netlify.com**
2. **Drag and drop the `dist` folder** after building
3. **Or connect to GitHub** with these settings:
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/dist`

## Status Check

✅ Backend deployed: https://toy-website-backend.onrender.com/
⏳ Frontend: Use Method 1 above

The API URL typo has been fixed in your code!
