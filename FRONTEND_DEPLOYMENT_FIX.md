# Frontend Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified
The frontend is failing to connect to the backend service. The backend is working correctly (tested and confirmed), but the frontend deployment has configuration issues.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. ✅ Backend is working: `https://toy-website-backend.onrender.com/api/products` returns data
2. ❌ Frontend environment variables may not be properly set in Vercel deployment
3. ❌ Build process may not be using the correct environment file

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Vercel Environment Variables (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard** → Select your toy_website project
2. **Go to Settings → Environment Variables**
3. **Add these variables** (copy exactly):

```
VITE_API_URL = https://toy-website-backend.onrender.com/api
VITE_APP_NAME = Kids Toys Ecommerce
VITE_APP_VERSION = 1.0.0
VITE_DEV_MODE = false
VITE_DEBUG = false
VITE_IMAGE_QUALITY = 85
VITE_LAZY_LOADING = true
VITE_CACHE_TTL = 300000
VITE_PAGINATION_LIMIT = 12
VITE_ENABLE_INFINITE_SCROLL = true
VITE_ENABLE_VIRTUAL_SCROLLING = false
VITE_ENABLE_SERVICE_WORKER = true
```

4. **Redeploy** your project (go to Deployments tab → click the 3 dots → Redeploy)

### Solution 2: Manual Build and Upload

If Vercel is still having issues, you can build locally and upload:

1. **Open terminal in the frontend folder**
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Build the project**: `npm run build`
4. **Upload the `dist` folder** to any static hosting service:
   - Netlify (drag and drop)
   - Vercel (manual upload)
   - GitHub Pages
   - Any other static host

### Solution 3: Alternative Hosting - Netlify

1. **Go to https://netlify.com**
2. **Connect to GitHub** or **drag/drop the dist folder**
3. **Build settings** (if connecting to GitHub):
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/dist`
4. **Environment variables** (same as above)

## Quick Test Commands

### Test Backend (should work):
```bash
# PowerShell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://toy-website-backend.onrender.com/api/products"

# Should return status 200 with product data
```

### Test Frontend After Fix:
1. Open your deployed frontend URL
2. Check browser Developer Tools → Network tab
3. Look for API calls to `https://toy-website-backend.onrender.com/api/*`
4. They should return status 200, not CORS or network errors

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" Error
- **Cause**: Environment variables not set in production
- **Fix**: Add VITE_API_URL environment variable in hosting platform

### Issue: CORS Error
- **Cause**: Backend doesn't allow your frontend domain
- **Fix**: Backend already configured for *.vercel.app and *.onrender.com domains

### Issue: 404 on Routes
- **Cause**: SPA routing not configured
- **Fix**: Already configured in vercel.json with rewrites

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Backend working: `https://toy-website-backend.onrender.com/api/products`
2. ⏳ Frontend environment variables configured
3. ⏳ Frontend redeployed
4. ⏳ Frontend can fetch data from backend

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix Vercel environment variables and redeploy
2. **Verify**: Test the deployed frontend
3. **Monitor**: Check for any remaining errors in browser console

---
**Status**: Ready for deployment fix
**Backend**: ✅ Working
**Frontend**: ⚠️  Needs environment variable configuration
